            </h2>
            <p>Gon Freecss is a young boy living on Whale Island. He learns from "Hunter" Kite, that his father, who he
                was told was dead, is still alive somewhere as a top "Hunter," risking his life to seek unknown items,
                such as hidden treasures, curiosa, exotic living creatures, etc. Gon decides to become a professional
                Hunter and leaves the island. To become a Hunter, he must pass the Hunter Examination, where he meets
                and befriends three other applicants: Kurapika, Leorio and Killua. Can Gon pass this formidable hurdle,
                the Hunter Examination, to become "the Best Hunter in the World" and eventually meet his father?

                <p>The Zoldyck Family arc is exclusive to the anime. It kicks off with Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika
                    traveling to Killua's family home deep within the Kukuroo mountain. This arc reveals the inner
                    details of the Zoldyck household, especially the borderline-abusive manner in which they treat any
                    child who steps out of line. Thankfully for Killua, he has a warm relationship with his father,
                    Silva, although his interactions with his mother leave a lot to be desired.</p>

                <p>This is the first Hunter x Hunter arc to be set entirely inside an urban sprawl — the titular arena
                    is a theoretically unfeasible building consisting of 251 floors. While Gon and Killua have a fun
                    time taking down the weaker opponents in Heaven's Arena, they are struck speechless (and motionless)
                    when they come face to face with Hisoka's extremely threatening Nen.</p>

                <p>The first arc of Hunter x Hunter introduces all the main characters in a rather efficient manner. Gon
                    meets Leorio and Kurapika on the ship taking them to the exam, which encounters a massive storm in
                    the middle of the journey. The real exam is a lot more difficult, largely due to the sheer number of
                    seemingly unrelated problems given to the aspiring Hunters.</p>

                <p>The Yorknew City arc is Kurapika's time to shine. It describes his suffering after the Phantom Troupe
                    coldly murdered the Kurta clan in order to steal and sell their precious Scarlet Eyes on the black
                    market. Kurapika captures one of the Troupe's members, Uvogin, after a long and rather perilous
                    fight. At the same time, the Ten Dons hire Zeno and Silva Zoldyck, two of the world's best
                    assassins, to kill Chrollo Lucilfer, the so-called head of the Spider.</p>

                <p>The Greed Island arc is one of the most exciting ones in the anime. It involves Gon and Killua's
                    adventures on Greed Island, a game invented by Ging and his friends. The intrepid pair experiences
                    some difficulty at the beginning, as they have to fight advanced combatants, but the introduction of
                    the fabulous Biscuit Krueger pretty much flips the game on its head.</p>
