            </h2>
            <p>Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans. Titans are typically several stories
                tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the
                pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in
                a land protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the
                present, and mankind has not seen a titan in over 100 years. One day, 10 year old Eren and his childhood
                friend Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that
                appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as Eren's
                mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of
                mankind.

                <p>The Battle of Trost District is the second arc of Attack on Titan. While it certainly packs a punch
                    when it comes to intensity, it is lacking in the story department. This arc takes place when the
                    students of the 104th Cadet Corps take on the Armored and the Colossal Titan in a fight.</p>

                <p>The Clash of the Titans arc is, quite possibly, the arc with the biggest twists in the story. The arc
                    begins when Wall Rose is suddenly breached and Titans appear out of nowhere. Immediately after, the
                    Survey Corps are thrown into battle and it doesn't take them long to realize that the threat that
                    they face is actually from within their own group.</p>

                <p>he Royal Government Arc is slightly different when compared to the other arcs in Attack on Titan.
                    This one involves a lot more politics than the vast majority of the arcs, yet, Isayama makes it so
                    that it becomes incredibly enjoyable to go through. It is during this arc that Erwin Smith plans to
                    overthrow the entire Government.</p>

                    be the entirety of the world. Across the sea, the Empire of Marley is explored in great depth. It is
                    revealed that they hold the power of several Titans, however, they come to the realization that this
