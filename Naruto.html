            </h2>
            <p>Many years ago, in the hidden village of Konoha, lived a great demon fox. When it swung one of it's nine
                tails, a tsunami occurred. The fourth hokage sealed this demon fox inside a boy in exchange for his own
                life. Naruto was that boy, and he grew up with no family, and the villagers hated him thinking that he
                himself was the demon fox. Naruto's dream is to become Hokage, and have the villagers acknowledge him.

                <h2 class="naruto-archead">1. The Land of Wave </h2>
                <p>The tension between the main trio, wrangled by their teacher Kakashi, is already rampant and there is
                    an exciting duel with the mysterious Haku and the fierce Zabuza. The tailed beast forms and
                    Sharingan are glimpsed here, but not fully explained which hints at what's to come. All in all, the
                    arc is low stakes compared to others, but a great start for the series.</p>

                <h2 class="naruto-archead"> 2. Sasuke Recovery</h2>
                <p>Also known as the Sasuke Retrieval arc, this arc marked a turning point for Naruto, both the
                    character and series. The story had its dark moments, but that darkness would amplify here. Sasuke
                    had left the village of Konoha, and Naruto forms a group to get him back. This arc marks the debut
                    of Naruto's promise that would carry until the end of the series.</p>

                <h2 class="naruto-archead">3. The Five Kage Summit</h2>
                <p>In direct contrast to the Land of Waves' simplicity, The Five Kage Summit arc is dripping in
                    complexity. The leaders of many great ninja nations come together to discuss what to do with the
                    Akatsuki. This results in an arc full of political turmoil. It does a great job of expanding the
                    world; bringing in characters previously only mentioned.</p>

                <h2 class="naruto-archead">4. The Akatsuki Supression</h2>
                <p>The Akatsuki Suppression Mission is a more understated arc in Naruto Shippuden. It comes between an
                    underwhelming arc and a plot-critical arc and concerns itself mainly with a battle with Hidan and
                    Kakuzu, who aren't among the organization's most notable members. However, the arc comes with a lot
                    of emotional weight as well.</p>

                <h2 class="naruto-archead">5. The Fourth Shinobi World war </h2>
                <p>The Fourth Shinobi World War is actually several arcs in one. Some would even consider the ending
                    arcs, like the reveal of Kaguya, to be part of this arc. This is because the Shinobi World War is
                    the defining climax of the story that everything had been leading up to. The biggest appeal of the
                    arc for fans is at the beginning and end.</p>
